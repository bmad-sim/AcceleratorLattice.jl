# AcceleratorLattice.jl
High energy accelerator lattice construction and manipulation.
Compatible with Bmad.
This is a long term project currently under development.

## Installing
1. Clone this Git repo. Typically to \~/.julia/dev/ 
```
  git clone https://github.com/bmad-sim/AcceleratorSimulation.jl.git ~/.julia/dev/AcceleratorSimulation.jl
```
1. In Julia do:
```
julia> import Pkg
julia> Pkg.activate(".julia/dev/AcceleratorSimulation.jl") # This is relative to the current directory
                                                           # so make sure you are in the root directory.
julia> using AcceleratorSimulation
```
