\section{What is Bmad?}

\bmad is an open-source software envionment for simulating charged particles and
X-rays. \bmad is not a program itself but is used by programs for doing calculations. The advantage
of \bmad over a stand-alone simulation program is that when new types of simulations need to be
developed, \bmad can be used to cut down on the time needed to develop such programs with the added
benefit that the number of programming errors will be reduced.

Over the years, \bmad has been used for a wide range of charged-particle and X-ray simulations. This
includes:
\begin{example}
Lattice design                                  X-ray simulations
Spin tracking                                   Wakefields and HOMs
Beam breakup (BBU) simulations in ERLs          Touschek Simulations
Intra-beam scattering (IBS) simulations         Dark current tracking
Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR)            Frequency map analysis
\end{example}
