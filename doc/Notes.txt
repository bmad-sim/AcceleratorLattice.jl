* Explain @kwdef macro for structs.

* Explain how to add custom attributes to an element:
    * How to extend the list of official attributes
    * What functions to extend.

* Explain that AcceleratorLattice.jl can be used standalone.

* ele.field_master: Only used if p0c changes. Default is false. (what group does this go into?)
* Bend .type attribute: Only used if rho, angle, g, bend_field changes

* Explain about switches and how to extend them.

* Element grouped and ungrouped parameters.

* Explain that overloaded dot selection "ele.who" is used to ensure some bookkeeping done in background.

* "Lattice" bookkeeping triggered by user (or optimizer).

* Lattice bookkeeping can be bypassed by setting the element group parameter directly.

* Old Bmad roll is "tilt" in new bmad.
* Bend x_pitch and y_pitch are about the chord center and not the bend arc center. This is the same as a girder.

* bend angle is always a dependent parameter dependent on g and len.
