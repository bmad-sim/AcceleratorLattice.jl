\section{Type Stability}
\label{s:type.stable}

There is a large amount of information on ``\vn{type stability}'' in Julia so this section will just 
be a short introduction to the subject and the interested reader is urged consult the Julia manual 
as well as the numerous internet articles.

Code is type stable when the Julia compiler can figure out what the type of a variable is at compile
time. For type unstable code, the compiler must add extra stuff to the compiled code to handle the
varias cases that arise when a variable has differing types. For example, with the code
\begin{example}
  a = b * c
\end{example}
the compiled multiplication code will different if \vn{b} and \vn{c} are strings versus integers versus reals, etc.
If the compiler knows the types of \vn{b} and \vn{c}, the execution speed of this code will be much
faster since the compiled code does not have to make any tests as to what the type of \vn{b} and \vn{c}
are. 

It is for this for this reason that ``strongly typed'' languages like C/C++ or Fortran are fast since
the type of all variables must be  declared in the code. A language like Python is slower since 
it is hard for the compiler to infer a variable's type. Julia is in between. Julia can be as fast as
a strongly typed language but only if the programmer takes care to ensure the code is type stable.
How to write code that is type stable is beyond the scope of this introduction and the reader should
consult the literature.

It is important to keep in mind that for code that even without type stability executes quickly and 
will not be executed often, it may not be important that the code be type stable. Indeed,
type stability can come at the price of flexibility and so adherence to type stability is not always warranted.
