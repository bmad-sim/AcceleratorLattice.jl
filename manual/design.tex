\chapter{Design Decisions}
\label{c:design}

This chapter discusses some of the design decisions that were made in the planning of \accellat.
Hopefully this information will be useful as \accellat is developed in the future.
The design of \accellat is heavily influenced by the decades of experience constructing and maintaining
\bmad --- both in terms of what works and what has not worked. 

First a clarification. The name \bmad can be used in two senses. There is \bmad the software toolkit
that can be used to create simulation programs. But \bmad can also be used to refer to the 
ecosystem of toolkit and \bmad based programs that have been developed over the years --- the
most heavily used program being Tao. In the discussion below, \bmad generally refers to the toolkit
since it is the toolkit that defines the syntax for \bmad lattice files.

\paragraph{Bmad history:}
To understand \accellat it helps to understand some of the history of \bmad. The \bmad toolkit 
started out as a modest project for calculating Twiss parameters and closed orbits within online control
programs for the Cornell CESR storage ring. As such, the lattice structure was simply an array
of elements. That is, multiple branches could not be instantiated. And tracking was very simple ---
there was only one tracking method, symplecticity was ignored and ultra-relativistic and 
paraxial approximations were used. 
\bmad has come a long way from the early days but design decisions made early on still haunt the \bmad
toolkit. 

\paragraph{Separation of tracking and lattice description:} 
One of the first \accellat design decisions was to separate, as much as
possible, particle tracking and lattice description. 
This decision was inspired by the PTC code of Etienne Forest.
The fact that \bmad did not make this separation complicated \bmad's lattice element structure,
the \vn{ele_struct}, 
to the extent that the \vn{ele_struct} is the most complicated structure in all of \bmad. And
having complicated structures is an impediment to code sustainability.
The lack of a separation in \bmad also made bookkeeping more complicated in cases where, for example, 
Twiss parameters were to be calculated under differing conditions (EG varing initial 
particle positions) but the \vn{ele_struct} can only hold Twiss parameters for one specific
condition.

\paragraph{Lattice branches:}
The organization of the lattice into branches with each branch having an array of elements has
worked very well with \bmad and so is used with \accellat. The relatively minor difference is
that with \accellat the organization of the branches is more logical with multiple lord branches
with each lord branch containing only one type of lord.

\paragraph{Type stability:}
Type stability is {\em not} a major concern with \accellat. The reason being that compared to
the time needed for tracking and track analysis, lattice instantiation
and manipulation is only a minor player. And for tracking, an interface layer can be
used to translate lattice parameters to a type stable form. Of much greater importance is
flexibility of the code to accomodate changing needs and software sustainability.

\paragraph{Lattice element structure:}
All lattice element structs are very simple: They contain a single Dict and all element information
is stored within this Dict. This makes adding custom information to an element simple. 

Within an element Dict, for the most part parameters are grouped into ``element group'' structs. A flattened structure
without the element group structs would simplify things and this would be the correct strategy
if the number of parameters for a given element type was not as large as it is.
